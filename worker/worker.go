// Package worker defines the worker registration and discovery abstraction for aether.
//
// WorkerRegistry is an independent interface that manages worker lifecycle
// (registration, unregistration, discovery) separately from task lifecycle
// (which is managed by broker.TaskBroker).
//
// The separation of concerns:
//   - TaskBroker:     task dispatch, cancellation, fetching, completion
//   - WorkerRegistry: worker identity, capabilities, heartbeat, schema propagation
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

// Registry manages worker registration and discovery.
//
// In a distributed deployment, workers call Register at startup to announce
// their identity and capabilities (supported executor types + schemas).
// The master (or broker) uses ListByExecutorType to find workers capable of
// handling a given task, enabling type-based routing.
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

// Info describes a registered worker's identity and capabilities.

// to populate its schema registry without a separate round-trip, enabling
// schema-aware validation even when executor plugins run on remote workers.
